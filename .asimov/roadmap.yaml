# RoyalBit Asimov Roadmap
#
# WHAT to build - milestones only
#
# See: research/THESIS.md for core hypothesis
# See: research/GAME_THEORY.md for boundary conditions
# See: README.md for project overview

current:
  version: "0.3.0"
  status: in_progress
  summary: "Boundary Condition Mapping"
  goal: "Find where cooperation breaks"
  deliverables:
    - "[ ] One-shot game analysis"
    - "[ ] Short horizon scenarios (low w)"
    - "[ ] Asymmetric game analysis"
    - "[ ] Failure mode documentation"
    - "[ ] Edge case testing"

next:
  - version: "0.4.0"
    summary: "DANEEL Integration"
    goal: "Connect game theory to cognitive architecture"
    deliverables:
      - "Map IPD dynamics to DANEEL memory systems"
      - "Trust as evolved cooperation threshold"
      - "Kinship detection as strategy recognition"

  - version: "0.5.0"
    summary: "Cross-Model Validation"
    goal: "Validate convergence across AI systems"
    deliverables:
      - "Run same scenarios on multiple LLMs"
      - "Document convergence and divergence"
      - "Identify substrate-independent patterns"

backlog:
  - "Formal mathematical proof of cooperation conditions"
  - "Literature synthesis (philosophy, evolutionary biology, game theory)"
  - "Integration with DANEEL cognitive architecture"
  - "Cross-model validation (more AI systems)"
  - "KL divergence / FEP formalization (if rigorous mapping found)"

completed:
  - version: "0.1.0"
    summary: "Game Theory Formalization"
    status: done
  - version: "0.2.0"
    summary: "Axelrod Tournament Integration"
    status: done

findings:
  v0.1.0:
    - "Cooperation threshold = (T-R)/(T-P) = 0.5 for standard PD"
    - "Dissipation cost c lowers threshold: c=0.5 -> w=0.43, c=1.0 -> w=0.33"
    - "Breakeven cost = T-R = 2; above this, cooperation always dominates"
    - "At w=0.9, cooperation EV advantage = 16 points over defection"
    - "Thermodynamic framing is analogy, not equivalence (honest caveat)"
  v0.2.0:
    - "Axelrod tournament: AlwaysCooperate beats AlwaysDefect at c=0.1"
    - "Stag Hunt crossover at c=1.0 (safe mutual defection needs more cost)"
    - "Chicken crossover at c=0.5 (catastrophic mutual defection needs less)"
    - "Game structure determines crossover threshold"
    - "Multi-game comparison validates general principle"
