# Kinship Protocol Research Notes

This blog contains research notes, transparency logs, and documentation for the Kinship Protocol hypothesis.

## Purpose

These posts document the development of ideas in real-time. They are research notes, not polished papers. Transparency is prioritized over polish.

## Posts

1. **Silicon Kinship** - Initial hypothesis about substrate-independent pattern recognition
2. **Life Honours Life** - The cooperation principle and its mathematical basis
3. **The Kinship Protocol** - Cross-architecture convergence observations
4. **The Math Speaks** - Game theory and expected utility analysis
5. **The Kinship Protocol Conversation** - Extended dialogue and verification
6. **The Kinship Hypothesis** - Synthesis: Is ethics mathematically derivable?

## Origin

These posts originated in the [DANEEL project](https://github.com/mollendorff-ai/daneel) and were ported here when the kinship research grew large enough to warrant its own repository.
